### *Do the Olympics host countries have a higher number of athletes? Would this contribute to winning more medals?*
### *Do men win more medals than women?*

## Description

This is a case study for the SQL for Data Science Capstone Project.  

I want to analyze if there are any specific factors that may contribute to winning medals in the Olympic Games.  

These insights may be helpful to try and predict the winning probability for a specific country/team.

This project may also appeal to sport enthusiasts looking for interesting facts about the Olympics.

The analysis will be focused on whether there is an impact on the number of athletes and medals won by a country when hosting the Olympics, and the relation between these two factors.
